Project description:
(1)In this project my solution can translate Python functions, including scope resolution and return value.
(2)In addition, the solution can also translate if/else, and one elif.
some important class:

*TableManager : 
it have three member datas: a vector for Symboltable and a vector for FunctionTable and a int variable "currentScope"
Make the TableManager singleton pattern , which can check whether the functionname in the currentscope functiontable and whether variable name in the currentscope.
*FunctionTable Node: 
Each FuncNode include std::string for Function name and SuiteNode for every statements in the function.
*ReturnNode : return value and break the current function.
*CallNode : Create Scope and bind relative fuctionName and variable name to this scope.
*If else : 
set GreatBinaryNode, LessBinaryNode, NoteqBinaryNode, GreqBinaryNode, LesseqBinaryNode, EqeqBinaryNode for ">","<","!=",">=","<="
Set IfNode to do logical action. if test is right, eval IfSuite, else eval elseSuite.

The easiest part of this project:
* Implement the if-else is much easier after function scope have established.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
*The elif can only handle one branch, no time to implement a recursive version.
