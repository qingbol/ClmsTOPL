Project description:
*Design and implement AST to interpret some python code
*Finished integer,float,string types.
*Implemented basic arithmetic operation of values and variables and expressions 
such as: {x + y, x − y, x ∗ y, x/y, x//y, x%y, x**e, (x), −x, +x}.
*Implemented the following additional forms of assignment:
{ x+ = y, x− = y, x∗ = y, x/ = y, x// = y, x% = y }.
*Implemented string slicing.
Use static_cast<const IntLiteral*>($1->eval())->get_val() to get the index value.
Use static_cast<const StringLiteral*>($1->eval())->get_val() to get the string value.
Then use substr function to implement the slicing in c++.
*I designed and passed 349 test cases including the above operation.

The easiest part of this project:
* Implement the plus and multiply operation in  int and float type 

Problems that I had in completing this project:
*It took me a lot time to figure out how to implement the string slicing.
* The grammar in parse.y is too complecated to totally understand.
