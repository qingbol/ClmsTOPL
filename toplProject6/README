Project description:
This project implemented the following translation.
(1)Project4: handle integer,float, string(including slicing), variable, PRINT, 
             assignment, expressions(such as x+y, x-y, x*y, x/y, x//y, x%y,
             x**y, (x), -x, +x, booleans).
(2)Project5: handle functions(including scope resolution, return), if/elif/else.
             handle relational operation(such as <, <=, ==, >, >=, !=).
(3)project6: handle function parameter(actual and formal), pass by value.
             handle function recursion.

The cases directory contains 31 .py files which have 366 usecases.

some new important class:
In order to handle function parameter, I added two new Nodes: ParameterNode and 
ArgumentNode. 

The easiest part of this project:
* Design test cases is the easier part, 
but debug the codes to get the test cases run properly is difficult.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
*It took me a lot time to bind the parameter and argument together,
 it's a tricky part.
